## Mapping Race and Resistance: The 52nd Annual Morris Fromkin Memorial Lecture

This year's Morris Fromkin Memorial Lecture focuses on the racial geography of Milwaukee - and the role of racial housing covenants have played in defining ongoing racial boundaries in our city. But it is also a story of resistance. According to speakers Anne Bonds and Derek Handley, "Our focus on efforts to challenge covenants explores the lived experiences of covenants and ways in which Black organizations and residents of Milwaukee County envisioned and articulated their claims for racial and spatial justice."

## Racially restrictive real estate covenants

Property deeds and real estate covenants govern restrictions on the use of property. During the early to mid-twentieth century, these documents were often used to prevent people who were not white from buying property in certain areas.[^1]

The covenant pictured here is from the Lloyd Barbee Papers in the UWM Archives. This covenant, dated June 1940, restricts occupancy to white people, but makes an exception for "domestic servants domiciled with an owner or tenant." Such a clause not only restricts ownership, but assigns an "acceptable" role for non-whites who enter the neighborhood.

## Redlining

This 1938 map of Milwaukee was created by Home Owners' Loan Corporation - a federal agency created as part of the New Deal to help stabilize the home mortgage market. But it also introduced the concept of redlining. Neighborhoods were designated by different grades meant to signify investment risk. These grades effectively outlined the racial contours of the city and systematially embedded economic disadvantages by making it difficult or impossible to secure home loans in areas deemed low ("third" or "fourth") grade.
